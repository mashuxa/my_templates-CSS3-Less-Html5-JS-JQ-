    <h1>ETE for Learning: Visual Arts</h1>
    <p>Many people think that a career in Visual Arts or design is something about creativity and free flight of thoughts. Partly they are right, creativity is a cornerstone of any individual who connects his/her life with Visual Arts. But few people think about the fact that becoming a professional designer also requires to master a lot of theoretical knowledge. Understanding the theory, for example, why some colors, shapes or materials don't work together, requires sufficient amount of reading and learning. ETE Software from Vumingo takes the theoretical part upon itself, leaving creativity to designers and visual arts professionals.</p>
