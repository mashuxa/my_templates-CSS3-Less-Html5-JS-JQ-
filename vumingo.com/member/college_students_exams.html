The exam preparation process requires lots of studying, endless hours of reading and a huge array of information to remember and analyze. Some college students think that it is impossible to take their exams. But Exam Testing Engine helps even desperate students. </p>

Moreover, ETE supports all non-English characters, so it can be easily used by students whose native language is other than English/Latin based.</p>
