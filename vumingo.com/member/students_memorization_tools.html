    <p>Testing is a widespread asset for verifying students’ knowledge. But it is used not only for checking individual’s skills, testing is a valid approach to actually help students learn. Testing develops a long-term memory, after all, trying to answer a question, possibly failing and then remembering the correct answer, is an effective way to learn things.</p>
    <p>Tests have existed for a long time, but they called flashcards, tutors and educators used such an approach to memorize foreign words, historic dates, chemistry formulas. Today, flashcards are replaced with interactive computer-based tests. But the problem is that it's hard to find a test that targets EXACTLY what a learner needs at a particular stage. Here ETE comes to the rescue. This Software allows to create flexible interactive tests for every student, for every learning stage, for every knowledge level.</p>
