    <h1>ETE for Learning: College</h1>
    <p>Entering the college is one of the most important moments in life of every student. Of course, it is very exciting and great happing but at the same time it is rather challenging and stressful. Students move to a new level, naturally, switching curriculums and learning approaches may be hard for many freshmen. Indeed, is there no tool which could help students to adapt to new conditions? Vumingo took care of freshmen and released Exam Testing Engine which turns even the most stressful test into interactive quiz.</p>
